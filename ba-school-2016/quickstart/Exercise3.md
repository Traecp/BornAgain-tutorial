# Exercise 3: particle rotation

## Tasks
Use the sample from exercise2. Particles should be placed on the bottom of the polymer layer.

![Sample](img/ex3_fig1.png)

1. Rotate particles around X axis by 45$^{\circ}$. Does the particle position need to be adjusted? Set the correct value for the particle position.
2. Repeat the same for Y and Z axis.
3. **Advanced:** Create Euler rotation which turns the particle upside down and rotates it by 30 degree around Z axis. How to represent the same transformation with the set of consequent simple rotations? Adjust the particle position if needed.
