# GUI demonstration: interference, graded layers and roughness

## Interference + graded layer

* Take default GISAS instrument
* Increase resolution to 200x200
* Drag and drop `Cylinders and prisms` example
* Remove prisms
* Set particle delta to 4e-6
* Simulate
* Add finite 2d square lattice: 10x10 with 10nm lattice constant
* Simulate
* Set to `Average Layer Material`
* Simulate
* Use `Real Time Activity` to increase/decrease lattice constant (at low values, no output is generated)

## Roughness

* Remove last sample
* Drag and drop `Multilayer with correlated roughness`
* Simulate (ambient layer method)
* Play with cross correlation length
* Set cross correlation length to zero
* Play with all parameters of top roughness
