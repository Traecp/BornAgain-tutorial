# Suggestions from Gennady

**Basic principles:**

+ School is organized in items, where short lectures are interchanged with live demos and hand on sessions.
+ Suggested item duration: ~ 30 min (lecture/demo+hands-on session).
+ Each item should contain part interesting for advanced users to keep them busy during hands-on sessions.
+ Ideally, all lecture content should be detailed in pdf, printed copy provided for each user.

**Tutorial requirements:**

+ Should be Jupyter based.
+ Should include things we need for BornAgain scripting (numpy, matplotlib, a bit of inheritance, Python callable).
+ Hands-on task should be presented in two files: task with code placeholders to fill missed parts, complete solution for whose who fail.

**Blocks:**

+ Wednesday, morning session
  + Installations
  + Python tutorial
+ Wednesday, evening session
  + Introduction
  + BornAgain GUI simulation basics
  + Simple examples, particle distribution, graded interface
  + Interference functions
  + BornAgain GUI fit basics

  + Lecture of Professor
+ Thursday, evening session
  + Fitting from Python
  + Specular simulations
  + Real data analysis
  + Posters, user samples and help in simulating their data
+ Friday, morning session
  + Polarization
  + Advanced data analysis
