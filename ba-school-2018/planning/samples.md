### The list of samples for the tutorial

#### GISAS/SAS

- ordered nanoparticles with rotated lattice domains
- gratings
- disordered nanoparticles (various kinds of disorder: layout, size distribution, rotation distribution)
- large particles, for example nanotubes, instrument resolution limits
- mesocrystal
- magnetic nanoparticles
- particles crossing interfaces
- advanced: manually construct magnetic domains

### Reflectivity

- multilayer, roughness, correlated roughness
- advanced: layers with density gradients
- fit several datasets simultaneously

### Other

- resonator (depth profile)
- supermirror (offspec)
